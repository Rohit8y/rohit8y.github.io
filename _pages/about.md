I'm a machine learning engineer with a passion for computer vision and AI. I recently completed my MSc in Computing Science from the University of Groningen with specialisation in Intelligent Systems & Visual Computing. I did my master thesis on detecting fake images generated by diffusion models using contrastive learning under the supervision of <a href="http://jiapan.nl">prof. Jiapan Guo</a> and in partnership with <a href="https://www.slimmer.ai/">Slimmer AI</a> and <a href="https://group.springernature.com/in/group">Springer Nature</a>.
